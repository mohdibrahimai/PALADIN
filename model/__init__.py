"""Model components for PALADIN.

The model package contains the simple answerer and proof planner used
in this reference implementation.  These components are deliberately
lightweight and ruleâ€‘based: the answerer extracts candidate answers
using heuristics and the planner builds a minimal evidence graph from
retrieved documents.  In a production system you should replace
these with properly trained language models.
